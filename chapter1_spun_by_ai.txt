Okay, here's a modern spin on Chapter 1 of "The Gates of Morning," aiming to keep the original meaning while using more contemporary language and pacing:

**CHAPTER 1: The Canoe Builder**

Dick stood on a coral outcrop, gazing south.

Behind him, the ocean breakers crashed, sending spray into the wind. In front, the lagoon of Karolin stretched out, calm as a lake—an endless blue dotted with gulls. A massive pond enclosed by a forty-mile coral reef, it was a sea in itself: a storm-tossed monster during heavy winds, a tranquil azure in gentle breezes. And now, after landing only yesterday, it was *his*.

Women, kids, teenagers—the whole tribe was buzzing on the beach under the blazing sun. Fishing with nets, playing games, tending their gardens. They were his people now. The canoes pulled up on the sand were his, too. So were the empty houses, once home to the war canoes of the past.

Dick’s gaze shifted from the lagoon to the canoe houses, and his brow furrowed. He turned his back on the peaceful water, facing the northern sea. Somewhere out there, beyond the horizon, lay Palm Tree Island. Beautiful, they said, like a dream—but crawling with devils.

Little Tari, son of the net maker Le Taioi, sat nearby on the coral. He didn’t know much about life, but he knew the island had been left defenseless. All the men of Karolin had been swept away by war, leaving the women, boys, and children without protection or leadership.

Then, yesterday, from the northern sea, a stranger had arrived in a strange boat, accompanied by Katafa, the girl who'd been lost at sea years ago. This new figure, the women whispered, was sent by the gods to be their chief, their leader.

The kid didn’t know anything about gods, or much care. Now alone with this fascinating stranger, away from his mother's earshot, he just blurted out the question:

“Taori,” little Tari asked, “who are you?”

Could Dick even *begin* to answer? Could Tari possibly understand? “Tari, I come from beyond anything you know. My name is Dick Lestrange. When I was smaller than you, Tari, I was stranded with an old sailor on that island you call Marua (Palm Tree). We lived there. Kearney, the sailor, taught me to fish, made me toys—little ships, nothing like your canoes. Then, one day, Katafa arrived, the girl who got lost from here in a storm. She lived with us after Kearney died. She taught me your language; she called me Taori. We loved each other, and could have stayed on Marua forever. But then a ship came, filled with dangerous men from the eastern islands of Melanesia. They came to chop down trees. Then, they rebelled, killed the white men with them, burned the ship, and we fled in our boat. We grabbed what we could, even the little ships, and steered for Karolin, guided by the lagoon light in the sky."

But he *couldn't* tell Tari all that. The name "Dick" was almost lost to him, along with the language of his childhood. Kearney, the sailor, was a fading memory, a face in the luminous haze of his past.

For men shipwrecked and alone, the past blurs and fades. For Dick, it began with Katafa's arrival. Everything before that was gone, burned away by the relentless tropical sun, the crashing storms, the humid mists of the rainy seasons. Kearney would have been forgotten altogether if it weren’t for the little ships he had made as playthings for the boy who was now a man.

He looked down at the child. “I am Taori, Tari tatu, why do you ask?”

“I don’t know,” the child shrugged. “I just ask. The adults– madyana– never answer the questions of Tari. Ai! The fish!” His attention already gone, drawn away by the cries of children hauling in a net, he scrambled to his feet and trotted away.

Dick turned back to the north. The child's question had stirred something. He saw the schooner that had landed on Palm Tree, only to be burned by the Melanesians. He saw Katafa and himself escaping in the old dinghy Kearney had taught him to handle. He remembered landing on this beach yesterday, surrounded by the women and children, who believed he was sent by the gods to lead them.

But as he stared north, the memory of the men he and Katafa had escaped stained the beauty of the sea and sky.

There was no *immediate* threat from the men on Palm Tree; they had no canoes. But they *would* build them. He knew it. And they would see the Karolin lagoon's glow reflected in the sky, just as he had. Eventually, they would come.

Dick was almost a native now, but the white man’s mind was still there. He could think ahead, analyze the situation, and imagine possibilities.

That's why he'd sent a canoe that morning to the southern beach for Aioma, Palia, and Tafata—three old men, past fighting age, but master canoe builders. That's why, as he looked over the gathered tribe, his eyes had registered the hundred or so young men on the cusp of adulthood, ready for war. But more than anything, fueling his thoughts, raising his courage, was his love for Katafa, his other half, threatened by the dangers he knew could come.

War canoes! Did he plan to fight the invaders in the lagoon, as they approached the shore? Or did he vaguely intend to attack first, eliminating the threat before it could grow? Who knows?

A hand touched his shoulder. He turned to see Katafa, a strand of her dark hair escaping the vine holding it back, fluttering in the breeze like an eagle’s feather. Her dark, luminous eyes weren't meeting his. They were fixed on the northern horizon where he'd been staring.

"Look!" Katafa said.

Under certain weather conditions, Palm Tree, though far beyond the horizon, became visible from Karolin through mirage. They'd seen it last evening, and now it was happening again. Starting as a mysterious stain low in the sky, a dull spot in the shimmering heat, it slowly hardened, taking shape as if sketched by an invisible hand. The island appeared, beautiful as a dream, diaphanous yet vivid.

Hand on his shoulder, they stood in silence, their minds uneducated, knowing nothing of mirages. Their eyes fixed on the place they had escaped, the place now rising so strangely above the horizon as if to watch them.

They saw again the horde of savages on the beach, figures monstrous as nightmares, they felt again the wind that filled the sail as the dinghy raced for safety and the open sea, and again they heard the yells of the Melanesians mad with rum stolen from the schooner they had brought in, and which they had burnt. And there, there before them lay the scene of the Tragedy, that lovely picture which showed nothing of the demons that still inhabited it.

As Dick looked at this beauty—a beauty that was also a threat—his nostrils flared, and his eyes darkened with hatred. They had threatened *him*—that was nothing. But they had threatened Katafa—that was everything. And they *still* threatened her.

Some day, they would come. The vision of Palm Tree seemed to echo the instinct in his gut. They would build canoes, see the lagoon's reflection in the sky, and they would come. They had no women, and here were women. Instinct whispered that just as he had been drawn to Katafa, these men would be drawn to the women of Karolin. They would scan the horizon in search of some island whose tribe might be raided of its women and seeing the lagoon light they would come.

If he only knew it, danger lay not only to the north, but wherever greed or desire or hatred might roam on that azure sea, not only amongst savages, but the wolves of civilization.

For Dick, the world was limited to the water surrounding these two islands. There was no Europe, no America, no history but the history of his and Katafa's short lives. And yet, even in that short time, he had learned to fear men and had glimpsed the heart of all history: man's instinct for war, rape, and destruction.

The vision of Palm Tree began to fade and then vanished suddenly like a light blown out. Turning from the sea to the lagoon, Katafa pointed to a canoe approaching from the southern beach.

It was the canoe Dick had sent for the canoe builders. Leaving the coral, they walked down to the white sand of the inner beach to meet it.
